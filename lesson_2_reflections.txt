What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created, and this is where git will keep track of the changes in the tracked files with some metadata. You need to do it so that you can track the changes made to files. You cannot commit anything if there is not a git repository there.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that you choose what to be tracked in a working directory. A repository may have multiple working directories.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

With the staging area I can simply add the files that are logically connected and make a commit with those, then add the other logically connected files and commit those. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Like the video said, when adding experimental features. Also, when making different versions (perhaps different languages) that need to be separate for the time being. Branches would help by keeping it organized and by keeping working versions alongside your experimental versions.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams show that git history is not necessarily linear. It can have many different branches, but each of these branches are essentially linear history until they converge or merge.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is one final branch that takes both changes from the two bramches. We represent it in the diagram this way because the branch history will be different between branches, and the parent commits will sometimes not be the preceding commit when merging branches.
